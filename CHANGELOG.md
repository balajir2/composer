# Changelog

All notable changes to Composer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Phase 1 — Execution engine core (2026-04-20)

#### Added
- [Phase 1 design spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-phase-1-execution-engine-design.md) — architecture for the execution engine, Prisma schema additions, Pydantic models for all 18 node types, checkpointer design, API surface, test plan, phase-exit checklist.
- [Decisions log](docs/design/decisions.md) established with ADR-0001 through ADR-0005:
  - ADR-0001: LangGraph checkpointer — Prisma owns schema, thin custom saver.
  - ADR-0002: Workflow JSON schema — full OAB fidelity (all 18 node types modeled in Phase 1).
  - ADR-0003: Documentation runs in lockstep with development (four-document system + enforcement).
  - ADR-0004: Local dev Postgres — Neon only (supersedes Phase 0's dual-path guidance).
  - ADR-0005: Phase 1 API surface (3 endpoints) + JWT primitives as library code only.
- Prisma schema: four tables — `Workflow`, `WorkflowExecution`, `LangGraphCheckpoint`, `LangGraphCheckpointWrite`.
- Pydantic envelope for all 18 OAB node types (`src/engine/workflow.py`), discriminated on `type`.
- `WorkflowStateDict` TypedDict with reducers (merge_dict, last_wins, operator.add) mirroring OAB's Annotation.Root.
- Executor protocol + registry (`src/executors/base.py`) with phase-aware NotImplementedError for unshipped types.
- Start + End executors (Phase 1 subset of OAB's 18 executor types).
- Graph builder (`src/engine/graph_builder.py`): shape validation, reachability BFS, LangGraph StateGraph compilation.
- `PrismaCheckpointSaver` (`src/storage/checkpointer.py`) implementing BaseCheckpointSaver's four async methods.
- `LangGraphExecutor` orchestrator (`src/engine/langgraph_executor.py`): creates WorkflowExecution rows, drives graphs, persists terminal state.
- REST API: `POST /workflows`, `POST /executions`, `GET /executions/{id}`.
- JWT primitives (`src/security/jwt.py`): access + refresh token helpers, not wired to routes (ADR-0005).
- Prisma client lifecycle wiring via FastAPI `lifespan`; `get_db` + `get_checkpointer` dependencies.
- CI updated with Postgres 15 service, Prisma migrate step, and split pytest (unit vs integration marker).
- Integration test (`tests/integration/test_start_to_end.py`) exercising the full engine path end-to-end.
- Regression test harness (`tests/regression/`) with one OAB-ported start→end smoke test.

#### Changed
- README points at `docs/design/` and `docs/superpowers/specs/` for design/spec/ADR docs.
- README stack table: corrected the real-time row to SSE (Phase 5) → WebSocket (Phase 9), matching the phased plan.
- `.env.example`: Neon-only `DATABASE_URL` format; added `TEST_DATABASE_URL` for integration tests.
- **Deliberate deviation from OAB behavior:** For a workflow with only `start → end` and no intermediate node, Composer's `finalOutput` equals the parsed input. OAB's `finalOutput` for the same shape defaults to `""` (because OAB's Start doesn't write `variables.lastOutput`). Rationale in [Phase 1 spec §7.1](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-phase-1-execution-engine-design.md#71-srcexecutorsstartpy). The ported regression test (`tests/regression/test_oab_start_end.py`) asserts the Composer behavior; OAB-equivalent assertions would need adaptation when more OAB tests are ported in Phase 7.

#### Removed
- `docker-compose.yml` (per ADR-0004). Local dev is Neon-only; integration tests in CI use a GitHub Actions Postgres service container.
- README "Offline fallback: local Postgres" section.

### Phase 0 — Scaffolding (2026-04-20)

#### Added
- Initial repo scaffold: FastAPI skeleton, Prisma schema placeholder.
- `pyproject.toml` with full dependency list (FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain providers, Prisma, pytest, ruff, pyright).
- `/health` endpoint returns service metadata.
- CI workflow (lint + typecheck + tests).
- `.env.example` template.
- MIT License.
- README with setup instructions.

> Historical note: Phase 0 originally shipped a `docker-compose.yml` for local Postgres fallback. ADR-0004 (Phase 1) supersedes that decision; Neon is the sole dev path going forward.
